If you are wondering: *Is this yet another blog about JavaScript and TypeScript?* The answer is: Nope! 🙅‍♂️

## So, what is this?

I don't think the world needs another blog about Javascript and Typescript.
**Yet, I do.**

In my journey of trying to be a better JavaScript Engineer I realized I needed a tool to:

- organize my thoughts
- "sort of" bookmark stuff I found particularly interesting, adding my considerations and some extra examples.
- force myself to dive deeply on some core concepts
- be committed in regularly publish some new content (definitely the hardest part)

I don't write this blog for you, I do it for me, but if you find something interesting and want to contribute, feel free to open a PR 👨‍🚀

## And why public?

As a form of commitment.

A Notion board can perfectly fit my need for a simple list of resources and thoughts about javascript, but being the blog publicly accessible on my GitHub forces me to put an extra effort and do that extra mile in writing it in correct English (I'm not native) and deliver higher quality, such as structuring the articles and adding references to the content.

## Welcome and Goodbye!

So, wrapping it up, if you accidentally landed here 🏄‍♂surfing the web and you found something interesting, that's amazing. A bit unexpected, but I confess that makes me proud.

Otherwise, you didn't find anything worth reading, or I didn't dive deeply enough on a specific topic to be useful, well... I'm sorry 😅

In both cases, feel free to reach out to me on twitter or via email, any feedback is appreciated and will be given a prompt response 👐

Peace.
Francesco
